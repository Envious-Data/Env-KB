# Env-KB
 A custom mechanical keyboard inspired by the CFTKB Mysterium

### What Im currently doing
* getting ready to make a first version PCB and send out to a couple people who were interested.



### What is to do?
* Design a case/housing
* figure out screw sizes and holes locations for mounting acrylic and the board to a housing.
* more pretty things


### Why a RPI Pico?
uh well why not, I think it would be a nice example for people to use as a example since python is surprizingly simple.
Ive made sure to leave GPIO 0 and 1 empty incase someone wants to add something like a I2C OLED or something of the sorts.

### ISO only?
for now I guess, its upto someone else if they want a ANSI version but I like the idea of adding another ISO custom KB to the market.

### Deviations!
Im not sure what to think about the base/backing place that the mysterium has though it does its job, For now I shall mimick its design though ive never been fond of philips head so if its easily possible to get my hands on robertson or allen head M2 screws (probably going to be allen).
