# Env-KB
 A custom mechanical keyboard inspired by the CFTKB Mysterium

### What Im currently doing
* Drawing Traces
* Organising Diodes


### What is to do?
* Organise Diodes
* Draw Traces
* Dictate needed components
* Build and test
* More stuff to be decided
* (at some point pretty it all up)

### As of right now
Ive mainly just laid out the schematic and rats nest using some online tools and also made sure the correct footprints are being used.
There are 2 spare GPIO pins on the RPI Pico so its possible to add a I2C device to this KB like a i2c oled or something of the sort.

### Why a RPI Pico?
uh well why not, I think it would be a nice example for people to use as a example since python is surprizingly simple.

### ISO only?
for now I guess, its upto someone else if they want a ANSI version but I like the idea of adding another ISO custom KB to the market.

### Deviations!
Im not sure what to think about the base/backing place that the mysterium has though it does its job, For now I shall mimick its design though ive never been fond of philips head so if its easily possible to get my hands on robertson or allen head M2 screws (probably going to be allen).
