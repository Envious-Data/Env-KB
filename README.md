### What is to do?
- Have a case designed

### Future plans!
- I would like to eventually replace the Raspberry Pi Pico with a onboard RP2040 based MCU.
- Replace CircuitPython with QMK

### Why a RPI Pico?
uh well why not, I think it would be a nice example for people to use as a example since python is surprizingly simple.
Circuitpython + KMK is being used here but if you wish you could write your own firmware, Im personally waiting for QMK to be ported.
I also quite like that this project serves as an example of what can be done with a Raspberry Pi Pico

### Consider helping out?
Feel free to make your own PCBs of this keyboard, if you feel like supporting me you can "Buy me a coffee"
Paypal: envy@envious.media

It costs me quite a bit to keep working on these projects because PCBs/Parts pile up in cost so I would highly apreciate if you feel like supporting me, anyone who helps me out I tend to hide their name on one of my PCBs as a easteregg/thank you.

### Things of handy dandy nature!
This keyboard makes use of KMKfw and CircuitPython

### Extra warning
The Windows 7 lacks drivers for circuitpython so you may need to download a driver pack from adafruit.
